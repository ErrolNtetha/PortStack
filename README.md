# C Program on Employees' database
I'm new to C programming. I'm trying to build a database by collecting individual details of each employees 
and save them in the disk file. The program itself looks complex, and perhaps disorgarnised. I would have use funtions 
but im still not understanding them quite cleanly. Suggestions and critics are welcomed.
