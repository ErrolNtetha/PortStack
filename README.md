# Employees' Database 
I'm new to C programming. I'm trying to build a database by collecting individual details of each employees 
and save them in the disk file. The program itself looks complex, and perhaps disorgarnised. I would have used functions 
but i'm still not understanding them quite cleanly. Suggestions and critics are welcomed.
